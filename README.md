MERN Book Store App
Description
This is a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) project with additional technologies including Tailwind CSS and Vite.

The app allows users to store book details, update them, and perform CRUD operations.

Features
MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing book data.
Express: A Node.js web application framework for building a RESTful API.
React: A JavaScript library for building the user interface.
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for the server-side application.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for responsive and visually appealing design.
Vite: A fast build tool for modern web development.
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm installed
MongoDB server up and running
Code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code)
