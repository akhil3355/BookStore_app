# MERN Book Store App

## Description

This is a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) project with additional technologies including Tailwind CSS and Vite. It serves as a refresher for MERN tech and demonstrates the integration of these technologies for a basic book store application. The app allows users to store book details, update them, and perform CRUD operations.

## Features

- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database for storing book data.
- **Express:** A Node.js web application framework for building a RESTful API.
- **React:** A JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime for the server-side application.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for responsive and visually appealing design.
- **Vite:** A fast build tool for modern web development.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js and npm installed**
- **MongoDB server up and running**
- **Code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code)**

3. Navigate to the client directory (`cd client`) and run `npm install` to install client-side dependencies.

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory for environment variables. Define the MongoDB connection string and other required variables.

5. Run the development server:

   - In the root directory, run `npm run server` to start the Express server.
